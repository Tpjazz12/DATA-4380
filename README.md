#NBA Playoff Predictor

This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict which NBA teams are most likely to make the playoffs and win the championship based on their performance statistics. The data is collected from the official NBA API and includes team standings and player stats.

Data Collection

The data used in this project is collected from the official NBA API using the nba_api Python package. Specifically, Gathering team standings and player stats for each season.

Machine Learning Models

The machine learning models is used to predict playoff rankings and championship winners is a random forest classifier. Each model on the preprocessed data is trained and tested their accuracy using a validation set.

Results

Our models predict playoff rankings and championship winners based on the input statistics. We present the top teams in each category based on their predicted ranking.

Acknowledgements

We thank the NBA for providing the data used in this project and the developers of the nba_api package for making it easy to access the data.
